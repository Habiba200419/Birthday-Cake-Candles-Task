# Birthday Cake Candles Task 🎂

This project solves the "Birthday Cake Candles" problem using **C++**. It includes:
- An **iterative algorithm**
- A **recursive algorithm**
- Pseudo-code
- Analysis and time complexity

## 🎯 Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers representing candle heights. Count how many candles are the tallest.

**Example:**

## 📂 Files Included

- `non_recursive.cpp` - C++ solution using an iterative algorithm
- `recursive.cpp` - C++ solution using a recursive algorithm
- `BirthdayCakeCandles_Documentation.pdf` - The pseudo-code for both algorithms and Comparison and time complexity analysis

## 🧠 Time Complexities

- Iterative: O(n)
- Recursive: O(n)

## 👩‍💻 How to Run
